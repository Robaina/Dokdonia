PR possible provides alternative to respiration under starvation  conditions in P. ubique (low Dissolved Organic Compounds)

González showed increased PEPc CO2 fixation under light  in PR-containing Polaribacter sp. MED152.

Kimura et al. transcriptomics light/dark in MED134, increased expression in TCA, glycolysis.

Alanine one of the most abundant aas in sea water and able to sustain growth on native sea water bacteria.

They propose that PR regulation depends on both light and the nature of the dissolved organic compunds (DOC)

Can bacteria have epigenetic modifications too? thinking of memory to temperature, acclimation of the bacteria studied by Laura.

González observed increased anaplerotic CO2 fixation under light in MED134, this is bicarbonate + PEP -> Oxaloacetate + Pi, ATP required for PEP, ATP generated through pmf, hence the connection to PR. 

In this study, authors observed a larger fraction of carbon in cell matter coming from bicarbonate fixation (up to 25% under light and yeat - peptone extract)

Again observed higher expression of PR genes under light and both Ala and yeast- peptone (YEP)

Observed increase in gene expression of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase but not of isocitrate dehydrogenase.

Some interesting expression patterns in Glyoxylate shunt (Figure 3!)

PR. Isocitrate lyase, malate synthase found in marine bacterial metagenomes with proportions: 54%, 43% and 78%.

They discovered that MED134 functions as a facultative double mixotroph: uses both light and organic matter as energy source and both bicarbonate and organic matter as carbon source.
